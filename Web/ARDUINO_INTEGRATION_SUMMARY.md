# Arduino Integration Summary

## âœ… Dashboard Updated to Match Arduino Firebase Paths

### **Arduino Firebase Data Structure:**

```json
{
  "soil": {
    "sensor1_percent": 65,
    "sensor2_percent": 70,
    "pump1": false,
    "pump2": true
  },
  "tank": {
    "level_percent": 45,
    "pump": false
  },
  "light": {
    "state": "BRIGHT" // or "DARK"
  }
}
```

### **Components Updated:**

#### 1. **SoilMoisture Component** âœ…

- **Before:** Reading from `/moisture`
- **After:** Reading from `/soil/sensor1_percent` and `/soil/sensor2_percent`
- **Features:** Shows sensor 1 data with visual gauge, logs both sensors

#### 2. **Irrigation Component** âœ…

- **Before:** Single pump control at `/pump`
- **After:** Dual pump control at `/soil/pump1` and `/soil/pump2`
- **Features:**
  - Separate controls for each pump
  - Individual status displays
  - Visual animations for both pumps
  - Different colors (blue for pump 1, green for pump 2)

#### 3. **LightSensor Component** âœ…

- **Before:** Reading from `/isDark` (boolean)
- **After:** Reading from `/light/state` (string: "DARK"/"BRIGHT")
- **Features:** Converts string to boolean for compatibility

#### 4. **Tank Component** âœ… (NEW)

- **Data Source:** `/tank/level_percent` and `/tank/pump`
- **Features:**
  - Tank level gauge with visual indicator
  - Tank pump control
  - Low level alert (when < 20%)
  - Visual pump animation
  - Status monitoring

#### 5. **Weather Component** âœ…

- **Status:** Placeholder (no weather data from Arduino)
- **Note:** Shows "--" until weather sensors are added to Arduino

#### 6. **Navigation** âœ…

- **Added:** Tank section to navigation menu
- **Icon:** Water drop icon with cyan color

### **Firebase Path Mapping:**

| Arduino Path            | Dashboard Component | Status    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| `/soil/sensor1_percent` | SoilMoisture        | âœ… Active |
| `/soil/sensor2_percent` | SoilMoisture        | âœ… Logged |
| `/soil/pump1`           | Irrigation          | âœ… Active |
| `/soil/pump2`           | Irrigation          | âœ… Active |
| `/tank/level_percent`   | Tank                | âœ… Active |
| `/tank/pump`            | Tank                | âœ… Active |
| `/light/state`          | LightSensor         | âœ… Active |

### **How to Test:**

1. **Start the React App:**

   ```bash
   cd Web
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check Browser Console:**
   Look for these debug messages:

   - `"Soil sensor 1 data received: [value]"`
   - `"Soil sensor 2 data received: [value]"`
   - `"Pump 1 status received: [value]"`
   - `"Pump 2 status received: [value]"`
   - `"Tank level data received: [value]"`
   - `"Tank pump status received: [value]"`
   - `"Light sensor data received: [value]"`

3. **Test Pump Controls:**

   - Click pump buttons to toggle Arduino pumps
   - Watch for real-time status updates
   - Check Firebase Console for data changes

4. **Monitor Data Flow:**
   - Arduino sends data every 2 seconds
   - Dashboard updates in real-time
   - All components have error handling

### **Expected Behavior:**

- **Soil Moisture:** Shows percentage from sensor 1 with color-coded gauge
- **Irrigation:** Two separate pump controls with individual status
- **Light Sensor:** Shows "DARK" or "BRIGHT" based on light sensor
- **Tank:** Shows tank level percentage with pump control and low-level alerts
- **Weather:** Shows placeholder until sensors are added

### **Troubleshooting:**

If data shows "--" or "Unknown":

1. Check Arduino is connected to WiFi
2. Verify Firebase authentication token
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify data exists in Firebase Console
5. Ensure Arduino is sending data to correct paths

### **Next Steps:**

1. Upload Arduino code to ESP32
2. Test real-time data flow
3. Add weather sensors if needed
4. Customize thresholds and alerts
5. Add more sensors as needed

## ðŸš€ Ready to Test!

Your dashboard is now fully integrated with your Arduino code structure. All Firebase paths match exactly, and the dashboard will display real-time data from your ESP32.
